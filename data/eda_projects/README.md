# EDA projects data overview

This folder contains four different datasets for the EDA projects, three of which were generated via the [`init_eda_project_data.R`](https://github.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/blob/master/R/init_eda_project_data.R)
script. The four files so far are:

* [top_hitters_2019_batted_balls.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/top_hitters_2019_batted_balls.csv) - location of all batted balls by the top five hitters in the 2019 MLB season so far. Data generated by MLBAM Statcast and accessed courtesy of [baseball-savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) via the [`baseballr` package](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/),
* [nfl_teams_season_summary.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/nfl_teams_season_summary.csv) - summary of regular season performance for each NFL team since 2009, data accessed via [`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR),
* [wnba_sparks_sun_game.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/wnba_sparks_sun_game.csv) - all shot and turnover locations from the recent June 6th Los Angeles Sparks at Connecticut Sun game, courtesy of [WNBA stats](https://stats.wnba.com/) via the ['py_ball package'](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/py_ball),
* [tennis_2013_2017_GS.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/tennis_2013_2017_GS.csv) - tennis grand slam statistics for 3066 ATP and WTA matches between 2013 and 2017.  Data from Jeff Sackman's [tennis data repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann), retreived by Stephanie Kovalchik's [`R deuce` package](https://github.com/skoval/deuce/blob/master/DESCRIPTION), and synthethesized in Gallagher, Frisoli, and Luby's [`R courtsports` package](https://github.com/shannong19/courtsports).

# Top hitters batted ball data

Each row in the [top_hitters_2019_batted_balls.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/top_hitters_2019_batted_balls.csv) dataset corresponds to a 
single batted ball by one of the top five hitters so far in the 2019 MLB season: Mike Trout, Christian Yelich, Cody Bellinger, Josh Bell, or Joey Gall (top five determined based on [Fangraphs offensive runs created stat](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2019&month=0&season1=2019&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&startdate=2019-01-01&enddate=2019-12-31&sort=19,d). Each batted ball
contains the following information:

* `hit_x`, `hit_y` - the x,y coordinates for each batted ball,
* `exit_velocity` - speed (miles per hour) off the bat that the ball was hit,
* `launch_angle` - angle (in degrees) off the bat that the ball was hit where 0 means parallel to the field, so positive means in the air and negative means towards the ground,
* `batted_ball_type` - categorical label for type of batted ball, either `fly_ball`, `ground_ball`, `line_drive`, or `popup`,
* `outcome` - categorical event denoting the outcome of the batted ball. The following are __positive__ events from the perspective of the batter Christian Yelich: `single`, `double`, `triple`, `home_run`, `sac_fly`, and `field_error`. The following are __negative__ events from his perspective: `douple_play`, `field_out`, `fielders_choice_out`, `force_out`, and `grounded_into_double_play`,
* `pitch_type` - two letter abbreviation denoting the type of pitch that was thrown,
* `player` - last name of hitter: either `trout`, `yelich`, `bellinger`, `bell`, or `gallo`.

The two letter `pitch_type` abbreviations represent the following types of pitches
that can be summarized by two groups, (1) __fastballs__:

* `FF` - four-seam fastball (most common pitch in baseball),
* `FT` - two-seam fastball (more movement than `FF`),
* `FC` - cutter (look up [Mariano Rivera](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1737396-visual-breakdown-of-the-rise-dominance-of-mariano-riveras-cutter)),
* `FS`, `SI`, or `SF` = sinker / split-fingered,

and (2) __offspeed pitches__:

* `SL` - slider,
* `CH` - changeup,
* `CB` or `CU` - curveball,
* `KC` - knuckle-curve,
* `KN` - knuckleball,
* `EP` - eephus.

Note that the batted ball data may not contain all of the different pitch
types. The list above is just a comprehensive one if someone wants to look at more
pitch-level data from the MLB. This data is in the same format as the [Yelich batted ball data example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/yelich_2018_batted_balls.csv).

# NFL team season summary data

Each row in the [nfl_teams_season_summary.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/degrom_2018_pitches.csv) dataset corresponds to a single NFL team in a single
regular season. The column names are organized below by the type of information they contain, with
the first set of columns being self-explanatory:

* meta - `team` (three letter abbreviation), `season`, `division`,
* season outcomes - `points_scored`, `points_allowed`, `wins`, `losses`, `ties`.

The remaining columns correspond to offensive and defensive summaries of the team's
performance in the season separated by pass and run plays. We have the following
offensive passing statistics:

* `pass_off_epa_per_att` = expected points added (EPA) per pass attempt on offense,
* `pass_off_total_epa` = total EPA from passing plays on offense
* `pass_off_total_yards_gained` = total yards gained from passing plays on offense,
* `pass_off_yards_gained_per_att` = yards per pass attempt on offense.

The remaining columns (e.g. `run_off_epa_per_att`, `pass_def_epa_per_att`, etc) convey
the same statistics but switching the type of play: either `pass_` or `run_`, and
displaying offensive (`_off_`) versus the team's defensive (`_def_`) statistics.

The EPA variables are _advanced_ NFL statistics, conveying how much value a team is
adding over the average team in a given situation. It's on a points scale instead
of the typically used yards, because not all yards are created equal in American football
(10 yard gain on 3rd and 15 is much less valuable than a 2 yard gain on 4th and 1).
__For offensive stats the higher the EPA the better, but for defensive stats the
lower (more negative) the EPA the better__. 

# Los Angeles Sparks vs Connecticut Sun game

Each row in the [wnba_sparks_sun_game.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/eda_projects/wnba_sparks_sun_game.csv) dataset corresponds to an event taking
place during the June 6th, 2019 Los Angeles Sparks vs Connecticut Sun (the Sun won 89-77). 
Each event contains the following information:

* `period` - period of WNBA game in which event took place, 
* `clock` - time remaining in `period`, in MM:SS format (M = minutes, S = seconds),
* `las_score`, `con_score` - score for the Los Angeles Sparks (las) and Connecticut Sun (con) respectively,
* `description` - a full string description of the event,
* `team` - abbreviation (either `las` or `con`) of the team with the event (eg the team taking the shot),
* `event` - the type of event, either: `field_goal_attempt`, `foul`, or `turnover`
* `x_loc`, `y_loc` - the x,y coordinates for each event where `x_loc` denotes
the left to right location of the event with respect to the hoop (0, 0) and `y_loc` denotes
the vertical location of the event. All event locations represent approaching the
same direction,
* `field_goal_type` - categorical label of shot, either `two_pointer` or `three_pointer`,
* `shot_made` - binary indicator denoting whether the shot was made (1) or not (0),
* `assisted` - binary indicator denoting whether the made field goal was assisted (1) or not (0),
* `shooting_foul` - binary indicator denoting whether or not a shooting foul occurred (1) or not (0),
* `distance_from_hoop` - distance in feet from hoop that the event took place.

# Tennis grand slams data

Each row in the data corresponds to a grand slam match between two players.  A variety of summary statistics of the match are reported along with winner and loser information.  Variables include:

* `tournament` - one of the four grand slams: Australian Open, French Open, US Open, and Wimbledon
* `year`
* `winner_name` and `loser_name`
* `winner_rank` and `loser_rank` according to ATP or WTA, respectively at the time of tournament
* `Retirement`   whether the match ended in a retirement (i.e. one person was unable to finish the match).  Logical -- TRUE means the match ended in retirement
* `Tour` either WTA or ATP
* `round` - `R128` Round of 128, `R64` - Round of 64, `R32` - Round of 32, `R16` Round of 16, `QF` Quarter Final, `SF` Semi Final, and `F` Final     
* `w_*` and `l_*` stands for winner and loser, respectively where the suffix is one of many summary statistics including
* `ave_serve_speed`    in mph
* `n_aces` number of aces
* `n_winners` number of winners including aces
* `n_netpt_w` number of net points won
* `n_netpt` number of net points played
* `n_bp_w` number of break points won (to break the opponent)
* `n_bp` number of break points (to break the opponent)
* `n_ue` number of unforced errors
* `n_sv` number of service points won
* `n_sv_w` number of service points won
