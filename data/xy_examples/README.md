# x,y data overview

This folder contains the x,y datasets generated via the [`init_xy_data.R`](https://github.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/blob/master/R/init_xy_data.R)
script. The three files so far are:

* [yelich_2018_batted_balls.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/yelich_2018_batted_balls.csv) - location of all batted balls by the National League 2018 MVP Christian Yelich during the 2018 MLB season. Data generated by MLBAM Statcast and accessed courtesy of [baseball-savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) via the [`baseballr` package](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/),
* [degrom_2018_pitches.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/degrom_2018_pitches.csv) - location of all pitches thrown by the National League 2018 Cy Young award winner Jacob deGrom during the 2018 MLB season. Data generated by MLBAM Statcast and accessed courtesy of [baseball-savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) via the [`baseballr` package](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/),
* [curry_2019_shots.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/curry_2019_shots.csv) - all shot locations by Stephen Curry in the 2018-2019 NBA season, courtesy of [NBA stats](https://stats.nba.com/) via the ['nbastatR package'](http://asbcllc.com/nbastatR/index.html).

All of these datasets contain columns with x,y location information as well
as other variables for generating a variety of spatial plots. 

# Yelich batted ball data

Each row in the [yelich_2018_batted_balls.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/yelich_2018_batted_balls.csv) dataset corresponds to a 
single batted ball by Christian Yelich in the 2018 MLB season. Each batted ball
contains the following information:

* `hit_x`, `hit_y` - the x,y coordinates for each batted ball,
* `exit_velocity` - speed (miles per hour) off the bat that the ball was hit,
* `launch_angle` - angle (in degrees) off the bat that the ball was hit where 0 means parallel to the field, so positive means in the air and negative means towards the ground,
* `batted_ball_type` - categorical label for type of batted ball, either `fly_ball`, `ground_ball`, `line_drive`, or `popup`,
* `outcome` - categorical event denoting the outcome of the batted ball. The following are __positive__ events from the perspective of the batter Christian Yelich: `single`, `double`, `triple`, `home_run`, `sac_fly`, and `field_error`. The following are __negative__ events from his perspective: `douple_play`, `field_out`, `fielders_choice_out`, `force_out`, and `grounded_into_double_play`,
* `pitch_type` - two letter abbreviation denoting the type of pitch that was thrown.

The two letter `pitch_type` abbreviations represent the following types of pitches
that can be summarized by two groups, (1) __fastballs__:

* `FF` - four-seam fastball (most common pitch in baseball),
* `FT` - two-seam fastball (more movement than `FF`),
* `FC` - cutter (look up [Mariano Rivera](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1737396-visual-breakdown-of-the-rise-dominance-of-mariano-riveras-cutter)),
* `FS`, `SI`, or `SF` = sinker / split-fingered,

and (2) __offspeed pitches__:

* `SL` - slider,
* `CH` - changeup,
* `CB` or `CU` - curveball,
* `KC` - knuckle-curve,
* `KN` - knuckleball,
* `EP` - eephus.

Note that the Yelich batted ball data may not contain all of the different pitch
types. The list above is just a comprehensive one if someone wants to look at more
pitch-level data from the MLB.

# deGrom pitch data

Each row in the [degrom_2018_pitches.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/degrom_2018_pitches.csv) dataset corresponds to a 
single pitch thrown by Jacob deGrom in the 2018 MLB season. Each pitch contains
the following information:

* `plate_x`, `plate_z` - the x,y coordinates for each pitch (yes the MLB refers to the vertical location of the pitch with z) where `plate_x` means the left/right distance, in feet, of the pitch from the middle of the plate as it crossed home plate from the catcher's point of view with distances to the right as positive, left as negative, and `plate_z_` denotes the height, in feet, of the pitch as it crossed home plate,
* `release_speed` - speed (miles per hour) of the pitch,
* `release_spin_rate` - RPM (revolutions per minute) of the pitch when it is thrown,
* `pitch_type` - two letter abbreviation denoting the type of pitch (see lists above),
* `type` - result of the pitch, either (1) a ball in play (`X`), (2) a strike (`S`), or (3) a ball (`B`),
* `balls` - current number of balls in the at-bat prior to the pitch (integer ranges from 0 to 3),
* `strikes` - current number of strikes in the at-bat prior to the pitch (integer ranges from 0 to 2),
* `events` - categorical label for possible events that occur on a pitch such as a batted ball event (`single`, `double`, `triple`, `homerun`, `sac_fly`, `double_play`, `field_error`, `field_out`, `fielders_choice_out`, `force_out`, `grounded_into_double_play`, `sac_bunt`), baserunning events (`caught_stealing_2b`, `pickoff_1b`), or at-bat outcomes that __are not__ batted balls (`hit_by_pitch`, `strikeout`, `walk`).

This can be a useful dataset for examples with clustering as each type of pitch
varies in terms of the `release_speed` and `release_spin_rate`. Could additionally
use this for additive model examples, e.g. predicting the probability of a strike (`type == "S"`)
based on the `plate_x` and `plate_z` locations.

# Curry shot location data

Each row in the [curry_2019_shots.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/CMSACamp/master/data/xy_examples/curry_2019_shots.csv) dataset corresponds to a 
single shot taken by Steph Curry in the 2018-2019 NBA season. Each shot contains
the following information:

* `shot_x`, `shot_y` - the x,y coordinates for each shot where `shot_x` denotes
the left to right location of the shot with respect to the hoop and `shot_y` denotes
the vertical location of the shot. All shot locations represent approaching the
same direction,
* `shot_distance` - distance of shot in feet from hoop,
* `is_shot_made` - boolean indicating whether or not the shot was made,
* `period` - period of NBA game in which shot took place, (5 denotes overtime),
* `shot_type` - categorical label of shot, either `2PT Field Goal` or `3PT Field Goal` (this is Curry so expect more 3s...).
